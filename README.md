## Netflix Data Analysis Project
    
Author: Maya Buchanan

Project overview: 
This project analyzes Netflix content and user trends using a combination of machine learning, data visualization, and statistical methods. 
By exploring genre trends, release patterns, and IMDb ratings, this analysis provides insights into content popularity and growth over time. 
The project leverages Python libraries, including **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **gensim**, to perform detailed data cleaning, processing, and modeling.

# Features and Analysis

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaned the Netflix dataset by removing null and unnecessary columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed content release patterns over time; Visualized genre distribution and country-specific trends.

Sentiment Analysis on Descriptions: Utilized topic modeling with **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to extract themes from descriptions.

Polynomial Regression: Modeled Netflix content growth over time to predict future releases.

Machine Learning:
   MLP Regressor: Predicted IMDb ratings based on content features.
   MLP Classifier and Logistic Regression: Modeled popularity factors using **SVD** for dimensionality reduction and visualized decision boundaries.

  # Key Technologies and Libraries**

  Python: Data processing and analysis.
  **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**, **gensim**: Libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and topic modeling.
  **matplotlib**, **seaborn**: Visualization libraries for trend and pattern analysis.

  # Results

  This project successfully provided:
  Insights into popular Netflix genres and trends by year and region.
  Predictions for future content releases using polynomial regression.
  Decision boundary plots to illustrate machine learning model effectiveness.
